    "# You are provided with a weather dataset in CSV format containing various meteorological measurements (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, etc.) along with a categorical target column named Weather (e.g., Clear, Rain, Fog, Snow, etc.). Your task is to build a supervised classification pipeline to predict the weather condition based on the given features.\n",
